ParaMonte Example Directory  
===========================
  
This directory contains the ParaMonte examples for all supported programming environments.  
These folders do not contain standalone ready-to-use source files and must first be properly 
built by the right install scripts in the root directory of the ParaMonte project.

> For more examples, in particular, Jupyter Notebooks and MATLAB live scripts, visit the ParaMonte's examples
